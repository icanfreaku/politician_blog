## About our Team

We are a team of 5 members who are currently pursuing M.Sc Computer Science Degree at University College Dublin. We are working on a project titled **Politician 360** which builds a web app that will give trustful information about Irish politicians through a ranking system in which it ranks them by popularity, sentiment analysis or corruption mentions. The system will collect and mine the information from irish newspapers and twitter.

### Our Vision

Our goal is to provide a platform with trustful information about the politicians to people. People can have all the information at one place, so that they can know more about the individual politician and compare with others.

#### Why the idea?

We think that people would like to know better what the news and social networks are saying about Irish politicians. We believe that a rank could be a good indicator of which politician is most popular and what the general opinion thinks about them, specially with the sentiment indicator. For instance, it is essential to know if a politician has any relation with corruption. It could be that he is fighting corruption or doing corruption. Just the fact that he is mentioned in corruption news is a starting point to know what the politician is doing regarding that.

#### Target Users

The system is designed for anyone interested on Irish Politics and willing to have a centralized place where they can easily have access to news related to the Irish politicians and extra information such as a rank of the politicians. Basically, the users could be voters, news agencies, politics students and researchers.

#### Uses

* Users could use the Irish politician latest news and tweets section for having a easy way to get this specific information instead of looking at the web trying to find the related news by themselves
* Users could use the TOP 10 popularity rank to easily know what are the most popular politicians.
* User could use the rank by popularity to compare politicians and know which politician is being talked about more or less on the news
* Users could use the rank by sentiment analysis to compare politicians and know which of them has news and tweets talking about him negatively, positively or neutrally. That could lead users to understand if a politician is doing good or bad.
* Users could use the politician information page to know more about a specific politician.
